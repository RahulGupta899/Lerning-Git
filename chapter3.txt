The couple of days were tough for both of us but 
one day .......................................
...............................................
...............................................
From that day onwards i and she never looked back.


our love was eternal unit the point i met Dhariya,
every day i was in her thoughts...................
.................................................
.................................................
we were getting more close and started going out 
together for movies, lunch, presentations, hackathons,
meetings.
But soon i realized that i am doing wrong not only with
my eternal love but dhariya also, even to both of their 
familes and i am gonna ruin my own family like this.

one day i and dhariya was in the office cafeteria and i 
asked her like what does she think of me?
The reply was "you are a good funny and a kind person,
and i always wanted to have a good guy friend like you.
and now my wish is fulfilled".
That is the point when i come to know that Dhariya had 
already Friendzoned me.

Tough to accept, but a huge relief for my acquintance.
I vowed to myself that i will make her my best female 
friend and maintain my personality like she feels.

Now i, my love and dhariya are very close to each other.
Dhariya is the one who resolve our all husband-wife disputes
and we are the one who is always there for Dhariya.
